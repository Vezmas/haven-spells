On a success, the creature takes half as much damage, and is not {@condition deafened}. Each consecutive turn you activate this effect, the damage increases by {@dice 1d8}.

If it was an electrical storm, the lightning strikes occur in random places throughout the area. If you cast the spell in this way, in the same place, every day for a year, the storm lasts indefinitely, and it can only be ended by a with spell of a 9th-level dispel magic."
